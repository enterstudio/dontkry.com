You should use a module bundler when building Ember.js apps. Why?

* Encourages better development practices: decoupling, modularity, code re-use
* Easier access to third party libraries
* 

[webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) is a module bundler built with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Minimal knowledge of Node.js and npm is expected.

## Setup a Project Folder

* Create a new folder to house your new Ember.js app.
* Run `npm init` to create a `package.json`.
* Install the following Node.js dependencies:

``` shell
npm install webpack webpack-dev-server napa --save-dev
```
